      <p class="my-4">In 2020, a new high compute cluster (HPC) called Jetstream2 opened up aimed at research use cases. For many researchers, gaining access to an HPC typically involves having a preconfigured job scheduler, such as Slurm or Redis, readily available. However, Jetstream2 operates more akin to AWS EC2 cloud computing, providing researchers with the flexibility to launch virtual machines with varying CPU and RAM configurations. While this allows for the quick deployment of multiple machines, it also presents the challenge of effectively distributing job workloads among them.</p>
      <p class="my-4">JS2 instances are self-contained, eliminating the need for a job scheduler such as Slurm. What proves valuable, however, is a scheduler like Redis. Yet, there is a technical learning curve associated with its setup and operation. To overcome this challenge, I implemented Ben, a lightweight job scheduler that simplifies the distribution of workload across multiple machines. With Ben, researchers can efficiently manage and optimize their job scheduling on the Jetstream2 cluster. This allows them to make better use of computational resources and centralizes program logs for easy access.</p>

      </style>
      <p class="my-4">To get started with Ben on JS2, follow these instructions to setup and implement the scheduler. </p>
  
      <p class="my-6">First, we need to set up a virtual machine on JS2 that will act as our main server that will host the scheduler queue and logs. Ben itself does not need a lot of compute resources - I use a 2 CPU core machine as my Ben server. Once that is done, we can download the latest Ben binary from their <a href="https://www.poirrier.ca/ben/" class="link-style">website</a> or run the following commands:</p>
      
      <pre class="whitespace-pre-wrap overflow-x-auto bg-gray-900 p-4 rounded-lg">
        <code class="language-bash">wget https://www.poirrier.ca/ben/ben-2.16.tar.gz; 
        tar -xf ben-2.16.tar.gz;</code></pre>

      <p class="my-4">To compile the binary, you will first need to install pandoc and then compile:</p>
      <pre class="whitespace-pre-wrap overflow-x-auto bg-gray-900 p-4 rounded-lg">
        <code class="language-bash">sudo apt install -y pandoc
        cd ben
        make</code></pre>

      <p class="my-4">Then, add Ben to your path. Since we are using JS2, we can move the ben binary file to <code class="code-block">/usr/local/bin</code>.</p>

      <p class="my-4">Ben works by utilizing SSH forwarding with a local file socket. To start a Ben server, choose a name for your local file socket and run this command:</p>
      <pre class="whitespace-pre-wrap overflow-x-auto bg-gray-900 p-4 rounded-lg">
        <code class="language-bash">ben server -s /tmp/ben-test --snapshot /etc/ben/queue/test.ini -d</code></pre>

      <p class="my-4 code-block"><code>-s: path to the Ben socket file</code><br><code>--snapshot: maintains a snapshot of the queue in the file specified. This option allows us to recover the queue content in case the server process gets interrupted</code><br><code>-d: daemonizes the server</code></p>

      <p class="my-4">Now that we have a ben server running, we should start up the JS2 machines we will be using to run jobs on. I won't go over this process, but I have written a script for my own use <a href="https://github.com/CALeDNA/crux/blob/master/crux/main_vm/setup_instance.sh" class="link-style">here</a> written in Bash using Openstack.</p>

      <p class="my-4">To make everything run smoothly, we will create an alias for each of the machines we just created to our ssh config file in the main JS2 machine:
        <br><br>
        <pre class="whitespace-pre-wrap overflow-x-auto bg-gray-900 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <code class="language-bash">
        echo "Host $NAME" >> $CONFIG
        echo "HostName $IP_ADDRESS" >> $CONFIG
        echo "User $USER" >> $CONFIG
        echo "PubKeyAuthentication yes" >> $CONFIG
        echo "IdentityFile $PKEY" >> $CONFIG
        echo "IdentitiesOnly yes" >> $CONFIG
        echo "StrictHostKeyChecking accept-new" >> $CONFIG
        echo "" >> $CONFIG
            </code></pre>
      </p>

      <p class="my-4 code-block"><code class="">$CONFIG: path to the ssh config file (~/.ssh/config).<br>$NAME: name of the JS2 machine.<br>$IP_ADDRESS: IP Adress of $NAME.<br>$USER: username of $NAME virtual machine. The JS2 default user is "ubuntu".<br>$PKEY: path to ssh private key of the $NAME machine. This file should be place in ~/.ssh</code></p>

      <p class="my-4">Note: make sure the ssh folder has the correct permissions.  <code>~/.ssh</code>  should have 700 permission and everything inside  <code>~/.ssh/*</code>  should have 600 permissions.</p>

      <p class="my-8">To add each machine we created as a client to the ben server, we first need to setup ben in each of those machines just how we did in the main machine. To make this easier, we will install parallel-ssh:</p>

      <pre class="whitespace-pre-wrap overflow-x-auto bg-gray-900 p-4 rounded-lg">
      <code class="language-bash">sudo apt install pssh;</code></pre>

      <p class="my-4">Now, we can write a simple bash script to install ben:</p>

      <pre class="whitespace-pre-wrap overflow-x-auto bg-gray-900 p-4 rounded-lg">
        <code class="language-bash">
    parallel-ssh -i -t 0 -h $HOSTNAME "sudo apt install pandoc -y"
    parallel-ssh -i -t 0 -h $HOSTNAME "wget https://www.poirrier.ca/ben/ben-$BEN_VERSION.tar.gz"
    parallel-ssh -i -t 0 -h $HOSTNAME "tar -xf ben-$BEN_VERSION.tar.gz"
    parallel-ssh -i -t 0 -h $HOSTNAME "cd ben && make  && sudo mv ben /usr/local/bin"
        </code></pre>

      <p class="my-4 code-block"><code>$HOSTNAME: path to a text file with each line being the $NAME of each of the JS2 machines in the ssh config file.<br>$BEN_VERSION: In my case, 2.16</code></p>

      <p class="my-4">Now, we can add the JS2 machines as clients to our Ben server:</p>

      <pre class="whitespace-pre-wrap overflow-x-auto bg-gray-900 p-4 rounded-lg">
    <code class="language-bash">ben client -r $NAME -n $NODES --remote-path $REMOTE_PATH -s $BEN_SERVER --remote-socket $BEN_SERVER -d</code></pre>
      
      <p class="my-4 code-block"><code>$NAME: name of JS2 machine as used in the ssh config file.<br>$NODES: maximum number of jobs to be run simultaneously by this machine.<br>$REMOTE_PATH: path to ben binary in the client machine. In our case it is /usr/local/bin/ben<br>$BEN_SERVER: path to the SSH socket file of our Ben server. In our case, it is /tmp/ben-test</code></p>

      <p class="my-6">You should be able to run  <code class="code-block">ben nodes -s /tmp/$BEN_SERVER</code> and see the client machines you added.</p>

      <p class="my-4">To start adding jobs to the scheduler:</p>

      <pre class="whitespace-pre-wrap overflow-x-auto bg-gray-900 p-4 rounded-lg">
        <code class="language-bash">ben add -s $BENSERVER -c "/path/to/script.sh" $job -o /path/to/log/dir</code></pre>
      

      <p class="my-4 code-block"><code>-s: path to ben server socket file<br>-c: command you want to run as a job in the client machine<br>-o: log directory in main machine where Ben will store all stdout and stderr output<br>$job: name of ben job. It's not necessary to be unique but it will overwrite log files with the same job name.</code></p>

      <p class="my-6">To check the status of jobs added, run:</p>

      <pre class="whitespace-pre-wrap overflow-x-auto bg-gray-900 p-4 rounded-lg">
        <code class="language-bash">ben list -s $BEN_SERVER</code></pre>

      <p class="my-6">In many cases, it's useful to be able to add jobs from within a running job. The command is the same, since we named socket file in the client machine the same as in the main machine. Just add this to end of the script being run in a job:</p>

      <pre class="whitespace-pre-wrap overflow-x-auto bg-gray-900 p-4 rounded-lg">
        <code class="language-bash">ben add -s $BENSERVER -c "/path/to/script.sh" $job -o /path/to/log/dir</code></pre>
